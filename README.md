# SEP: Computer Vision & Deep Learning

## Overview
This project is the result of the "Software Development Practical" held at the Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich (LMU) in the WiSe 2025/26.
Under the subject Computer Vision & Deep Learning we, students of the LMU, were given the task of developing, training and evaluating our own Convolutional Neuronal Network (CNN) from scratch for the well known Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) problem.
Our project includes:
- Data Preparation & Preprocessing sripts for the RAF-DB, ExpW and KDEF datasets
- Three versions of CNN architectures showcasing our progress over the time
- Training & Evaluation scripts based on parameters configurable by any user
- Live demo with integrated FER and optional Grad-CAM explanation & Facial Keypoints detection
- Image & Video explaining scripts using Grad-CAM and optimization tools

This project was supervised by Johannes Schusterbauer & Ming Gui, also students at the LMU.
